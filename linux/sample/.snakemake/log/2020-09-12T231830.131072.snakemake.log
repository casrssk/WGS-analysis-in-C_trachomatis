Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 86 of /Users/satwantkaur/WGS-analysis-in-C_trachomatis/linux/sample/rules/variant_stats.smk:
Job completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds:
results/multiqc/multiqc_report.html
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
